# quadruped-walkgen

The objective of this project is the writing of a crocoddyl class in C ++ to use it in a simulation of the quadruped. It is based on a simplified dynamical model of the quadruped and used to solve a MPC problem. 

To run the exemple in pyhton, from the directory exemple : 
python3 exemple_simple.py

To run the benchmark in cpp, from the build directory : 
make -s benchmarks-cpp-quadruped
